## 🏆 Status Report: Frontend 100% Complete

The frontend for Sheena Sports is now **Feature Complete** for the MVP.
All UI components, user flows, and mock interactions are implemented. The application is polished, responsive, and ready for backend integration.

### What's Done?
*   **Authentication:** Login/Signup screens with Email & Phone (WhatsApp) flows. Guest mode included.
*   **Core Feed:** Hybrid stream of News, Live Scores, and "War Room" alerts.
*   **Match Intelligence:** Deep stats, visual lineups, momentum meters, and AI predictions.
*   **Exploration:** League browsing, Search, and "Dynamic Acca" builder.
*   **Community:** Discord-style chat channels, live polls, and user profiles.
*   **Admin Command Center:** News publishing, AI Agent content generation, and Team management.
*   **Support Pages:** Help, Legal, and Notifications centers.
*   **Utilities:** Data Saver mode, Theme switching (Dark/Light), and Localization.

### Is there anything left?
**No frontend features remain.** The next step is exclusively **Backend Engineering**.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Real-Time Data Requirements (News Agent)

To make the AI Agent useful for breaking news, **you must connect a Search API**.
Gemini does not know about events that happened 5 minutes ago. It needs "Grounding".

### The "News Agent" Pipeline
1.  **Trigger:** Admin selects a match (e.g., Lakers vs Warriors) in the Command Center.
2.  **Grounding (REQUIRED):** 
    *   The Backend (or Service) calls **Tavily API** or **Google Custom Search API**.
    *   *Query:* "Lakers vs Warriors game highlights, score, and quotes last 2 hours".
    *   *Result:* Returns ~5 text snippets of facts.
3.  **Synthesis:**
    *   Sheena AI takes these facts and writes the story in the selected **Persona** (Sheena, Oracle, Street, etc.).
4.  **Publish:** The result is saved to the Feed.

*See `services/newsAgentService.ts` for the integration point.*

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The app runs as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using `react-router-dom`.

*   **Frontend:** React (Vite). Hosts the UI, Pweza Chat, and Admin Dashboard.
*   **Backend (Required for Prod):** Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI).
    *   **Role:** Hosts the Database, runs Cron Jobs for live scores, hosts the **Telegram/WhatsApp Bots**, and proxies AI calls.
    *   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) recommended.

---

## 🤖 The Bot Ecosystem (WhatsApp & Telegram)

**Crucial Note:** Bots cannot run purely in the browser. They need a server that stays online 24/7.

### 1. The Strategy: "The Sheena Broadcaster"
Instead of just a chatbot, use these platforms as a **Distribution Channel**.
*   **Step 1:** Create "Sheena VIP Signals" on Telegram/WhatsApp.
*   **Step 2:** In the **Admin Dashboard (War Room)**, check "Broadcast to Bots".
*   **Step 3:** When you click "Broadcast Alert", the Backend pushes the text to the Bot APIs.

## 🔌 API Checklist (To Go Live)

1.  **Live Scores:** API-Football (api-sports.io)
2.  **Betting Odds:** API-Football Odds endpoints (api-sports.io)
3.  **AI Grounding:** Tavily AI (tavily.com) - **MANDATORY for News Agent**
4.  **Database:** Supabase
5.  **Payments:** Stripe (Cards) + TronGrid (Crypto)

## 🔧 Supabase setup (frontend)

Add the following environment variables to your project's `.env` (Vite will expose variables prefixed with `VITE_` to the frontend):

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` — your Supabase project URL (e.g. `https://xyzcompany.supabase.co`)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — your Supabase anon/public API key

Notes:
- Never commit the Supabase service role key to the repo. Server-only code should use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with a secure runtime (server, edge function, or CI secret).
- The frontend will use `services/supabaseClient.ts` to initialize the client with the `VITE_` variables.

Important security note:
- I noticed you added `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to your environment. That exposes the service role key to the browser build and public clients — please remove the `VITE_` prefix and store the key as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in your server/CI secrets immediately. If this key was pushed or used in client builds, rotate (revoke) the service role key from the Supabase dashboard and create a new one.

Server-side admin client:
- I've added `services/supabaseAdmin.ts`, a server-only Supabase client that reads `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from `process.env`. Use that client only in secure runtimes (server, Edge Functions, or CI), never in frontend code.


If you want me to also scaffold server-side examples (Edge Functions or a small Express server) for admin operations and cron jobs, tell me and I'll add them next.
